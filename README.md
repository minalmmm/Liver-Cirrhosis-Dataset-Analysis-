**Liver Cirrhosis Dataset**
- **Overview**
This dataset contains clinical data from patients diagnosed with liver cirrhosis. Liver cirrhosis is a late stage of scarring (fibrosis) of the liver caused by many forms of liver diseases and conditions, such as hepatitis and chronic alcoholism. The data is intended for research and analysis in medical and data science fields.

- N_Days: Number of days the patient was followed up.
- Status: Status of the patient at the end of follow-up (C for censored, meaning the patient was still alive, D for deceased).
- Drug: Type of drug treatment received (e.g., Placebo).
- Age: Age of the patient in days.
- Sex: Sex of the patient (M for male, F for female).
